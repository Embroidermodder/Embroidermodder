Embroidermodder is a free machine embroidery application.
The newest version, Embroidermodder 2 can:

* edit and create embroidery designs
* estimate the amount of thread and machine time needed to stitch a design
* convert embroidery files to a variety of formats
* upscale or downscale designs
* run on Windows, Mac and Linux

Embroidermodder 2 is very much a work in progress since we're doing a ground
up rewrite to an interface in C using the GUI toolkit SDL2.
The reasoning for this is detailed in the issues tab.

For a more in-depth look at what we are developing read our 
[website]\url{https://www.libembroidery.org} which includes these docs as well as the up-to 
date printer-friendly versions. These discuss recent changes, plans and has user and developer 
guides for all the Embroidermodder projects.

To see what we're focussing on right now, see the [Open Collective 
News]\url{https://opencollective.com/embroidermodder}.

The _Embroidermodder 2_ project is a collection of small software utilities for
manipulating, converting and creating embroidery files in all major embroidery
machine formats. The program _Embroidermodder 2_ itself is a larger graphical
user interface (GUI) which is at the heart of the project.

The tools and associated documents are:

\subsection Credits for Embroidermodder 2, libembroidery and all other related code

If you have contributed and wish to be added to this list, alter the [README on Embroidermodder 
github page](https://github.com/Embroidermodder/Embroidermodder) and we'll copy it to the 
libembroidery source code since that is credited to "The Embroidermodder Team".

\subsection embroidermodder-1 "Embroidermodder 1"

The Embroidermodder Team is also inspired by the original Embroidermodder that was built by 
Mark Pontius and the same Josh Varga on SourceForge which unfortunately appears to have died 
from linkrot. We may create a distribution on here to be the official "legacy" Embroidermodder 
code but likely in a seperate repository because it's GNU GPL v3 and this code is written to be 
zlib (that is, permissive licensed) all the way down.

One reason why this is useful is that the rewrite by Jonathan Greig, John Varga and Robin Swift 
for Embroidermodder 2 should have no regressions: no features present in v1 should be missing 
in v2.

\subsection features Features

Embroidermodder 2 has many advanced features that enable you to create awesome designs quicker, tweak existing designs to perfection, and can be fully customized to fit your workflow.

A summary of these features:

* Cross Platform
* Realistic rendering
* Various grid types and auto-adjusting rulers
* Many measurement tools
* Add text to any design
* Supports many formats
* Batch Conversion
* Scripting API

\subsubsection cross-platform Cross Platform

If you use multiple operating systems, it's important to choose software that works on all of them.

Embroidermodder 2 runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Let's not forget the [Raspberry 
Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org).

![features: platforms 1](../assets/images/features-platforms-1.png)

\subsubsection section Realistic Rendering

It is important to be able to visualize what a design will look like when stitched and our 
pseudo ``3D'' realistic rendering helps achieve this.

Realistic rendering sample \#1:

![features real render 1](../assets/images/features-realrender-1.png)

Realistic rendering sample \#2:

![features real render 2](../assets/images/features-realrender-2.png)

Realistic rendering sample \#3:

![features real render 3](../assets/images/features-realrender-3.png)

Various grid types and auto-adjusting rulers

Making use of the automatically adjusting ruler in conjunction with the grid will ensure your 
design is properly sized and fits within your embroidery hoop area.

Use rectangular, circular or isometric grids to construct your masterpiece!

Multiple grids and rulers in action:

![features grid ruler](../assets/images/features-grid-ruler-1.png)

\subsubsection section Many measurement tools

Taking measurements is a critical part of creating great designs. Whether you are designing 
mission critical embroidered space suits for NASA or some other far out design for your next 
meet-up, you will have precise measurement tools at your command to make it happen. You can 
locate individual points or find distances between any 2 points anywhere in the design!

Take quick and accurate measurements:

![features measure 1](../assets/images/features-measure-1.png)

\subsubsection section Add text to any design

Need to make company apparel for all of your employees with individual names on them? No sweat. 
Just simply add text to your existing design or create one from scratch, quickly and easily. 
Didn't get it the right size or made a typo? No problem. Just select the text and update it 
with the property editor.

Add text and adjust its properties quickly:

![features text 1](../assets/images/features-text-1.png)

\subsubsection section Supports many formats

Embroidery machines all accept different formats. There are so many formats available that it 
can sometimes be confusing whether a design will work with your machine.

Embroidermodder 2 supports a wide variety of embroidery formats as well as several vector 
formats, such as SVG and DXF. This allows you to worry less about which designs you can use.

\subsubsection batch-conversion Batch Conversion

Need to send a client several different formats? Just use libembroidery-convert, our command 
line utility which supports batch file conversion.

There are a multitude of formats to choose from:

![features formats](../assets/images/features-formats-1.png)

\subsubsection scripting-api Scripting API

If you've got programming skills and there is a feature that isn't currently available that you 
absolutely cannot live without, you have the capability to create your own custom commands for 
Embroidermodder 2. We provide an QtScript API which exposes various application functionality 
so that it is possible to extend the application without requiring a new release. If you have 
created a command that you think is worth including in the next release, just [contact 
us](contact.html) and we will review it for functionality, bugs, and finally inclusion.

An Embroidermodder 2 command excerpt:

![scripting screenshot](../assets/images/features-scripting-1.png)

\subsection build-and-install "Build and Install"

Assuming you already have the SDL2 libraries you can proceed to using the fast build, which 
assumes you want to build and test locally.

The fast build should be:

    bash build.sh

or, on Windows:

    .\build.bat

Then run using the `run.bat` or `run.sh` scripts in the build/ directory.

Otherwise, follow the instructions below.

If you plan to install the dev version to your system (we recommend you wait for the official 
installers and beta release first) then use the CMake build instead.

\subsubsection install-desktop Install on Desktop

We recommend that if you want to install the development version you use the CMake build. Like 
this:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    sudo cmake --install .

These lines are written into the file:

    ./build_install.sh

On Windows use the next section.

\subsection history History

Embroidermodder 1 was started by Mark Pontius in 2004 while staying up all night with his son in his first couple months. When Mark returned 
to his day job, he lacked the time to continue the project. Mark made the decision to focus on his family and work, and in 
2005, Mark gave full control of the project to Josh Varga so that Embroidermodder could continue its growth.

Embroidermodder 2 was conceived in mid 2011 when Jonathan Greig and Josh Varga discussed the possibility of making a cross-platform version.
It is currently in active development and will run on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows and Raspberry Pi.

_(UNDER MAJOR RESTRUCTURING, PLEASE WAIT FOR VERSION 2)_

Embroidermodder is a free machine embroidery application.
The newest version, Embroidermodder 2 can:

* edit and create embroidery designs
* estimate the amount of thread and machine time needed to stitch a design
* convert embroidery files to a variety of formats
* upscale or downscale designs
* run on Windows, Mac and Linux

For more information, see our website \cite{thewebsite}.

Embroidermodder 2 is very much a work in progress since we're doing a ground up rewrite to an 
interface in Python using the GUI toolkit Tk. The reasoning for this is detailed in the issues 
tab.

For a more in-depth look at what we are developing read the developer notes (link to dev notes 
section). This discusses recent changes in a less formal way than a changelog (since this 
software is in development) and covers what we are about to try.

\subsection Documentation

The documentation is in the form of the website (included in the `docs/` directory) and the 
printed docs in this file.

\subsubsection section Development

If you wish to develop with us you can chat via the contact email on the 
[website]\url{https://www.libembroidery.org} or in the issues tab on the [github 
page]\url{https://github.com/Embroidermodder/Embroidermodder/issues}. People have been polite 
and friendly in these conversations and I (Robin) have really enjoyed them. If we do have any 
arguments please note we have a [Code of Conduct](CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md) so there is a 
consistent policy to enforce when dealing with these arguments.

The first thing you should try is building from source using the [build advice](link to build) 
above. Then read some of the [development notes](link to dev notes.md) to get the general 
layout of the source code and what we are currently planning.

\subsubsection section Testing

To find unfixed errors run the tests by launching from the command line with:

    $ embroidermodder --test

then dig through the output. It's currently not worth reporting the errors, since
there are so many but if you can fix anything reported here you can submit a PR.

\subsection Code Optimisations and Simplifications

\subsubsection section Geometry

The geometry is stored, processed and altered via libembroidery. See the Python specific part 
of the documentation for libembroidery for this. What the code in Embroidermodder does is make 
the GUI widgets to change and view this information graphically.

For example if we create a circle with radius 10mm and center at `(20mm, 30mm)` then fill it 
with stitches the commands would be

```Python3
    from libembroidery import Pattern, Circle, Vector, satin
    circle = Circle(Vector(20, 30), 10)
    pattern = Pattern()
    pattern.add_circle(circle, fill=satin)
    pattern.to_stitches()
```

but the user would do this through a series of GUI actions:

1. Create new file
2. Click add circle
3. Use the Settings dialog to alter the radius and center
4. Use the fill tool on circle
5. Select satin from the drop down menu

So EM2 does the job of bridging that gap.

\subsubsection postscript-support Postscript Support

In order to safely support user contributed/shared data that can define, for example, double to 
double functions we need a consistent processor for these descriptions.

Embroidermodder backends to the postscript interpreter included in libembroidery to accomplish 
this.

For example the string:

    5 2 t mul add

is equivalent to the expression:

    2*t + 5

The benefit of not allowing this to simply be a Python expression is that it is safe against 
malicious use, or accidental misuse. The program can identify whether the output is of the 
appropriate form and give finitely many calculations before declaring the function to have run 
too long (stopping equations that hang).

To see examples of this see the `assets/shapes/*.ps` files.

\subsubsection svg-icons SVG Icons

To make the images easier to alter and restyle we could switch to svg icons. There's some code 
in the git history to help with this.

\subsubsection the-actions-system The Actions System

In order to simplify the development of a GUI that is flexible and easy to understand to new 
developers we have a custom action system that all user actions will go via an `actuator` that 
takes a string argument. By using a string argument the undo history is just an array of 
strings.

The C `action_hash_data` struct will contain: the icon used, the labels for the menus and 
tooltips and the function pointer for that action. There will be an accompanying argument for 
this function call, currently being drafted as `action_call`. So when the user makes a function 
call it should contain information like the mouse position, whether special key is pressed etc.

\subsubsection accessibility Accessibility

Software can be more or less friendly to people with dylexia, partial sightedness, reduced 
mobility and those who don't speak English. Embroidermodder 2 has, in its design, the following 
features to help:

* icons for everything to reduce the amount of reading required
* the system font is configurable: if you have a dyslexia-friendly font you can load it
* the interface rescales to help with partial-sightedness
* the system language is configurable, unfortunately the docs will only be in English but we can try to supply lots of images of the interface to make it easier to understand as a second language
* buttons are remappable: XBox controllers are known for being good for people with reduced mobility so remapping the buttons to whatever setup you have should help

Note that most of these features will be released with version 2.1, which is planned for around 
early 2023.

\subsubsection sample-files Sample Files

Various sample embroidery design files can be found in the `embroidermodder2/samples` folder.

\subsubsection shortcuts Shortcuts

A shortcut can be made up of zero or more modifier keys and at least one non-modifier key 
pressed at once.

To make this list quickly assessable, we can produce a list of hashes which are simply the 
flags ORed together.

The shortcuts are stored in the csv file `shortcuts.csv` as a 5-column table with the first 4 
columns describing the key combination. This is loaded into the shortcuts `TABLE`. Each tick 
the program checks the input state for this combination by first translating the key names into 
indices for the key state, then checking for whether all of them are set to true.

\subsubsection removed-elements Removed Elements

So I've had a few pieces of web infrastructure fail me recently and I think it's worth noting. 
An issue that affects us is an issue that can effect people who use our software.

\subsubsection qt-and-dependencies Qt and dependencies

Downloading and installing Qt has been a pain for some users (46Gb on possibly slow 
connections).

I'm switching to FreeGLUT 3 (which is a whole other conversation) which means we can ship it 
with the source code package meaning only a basic build environment is necessary to build it.

\subsubsection social-platform Social Platform

Github is giving me a server offline (500) error and is still giving a bad ping.

So... all the issues and project boards etc. being on Github is all well and good assuming that 
we have our own copies. But we don't if Github goes down or some other major player takes over 
the space and we have to move (again, since this started on SourceForge).

This file is a backup for that which is why I'm repeating myself between them.

\subsubsection opengl OpenGL

OpenGL rendering within the application. This will allow for Realistic Visualization - Bump 
Mapping/OpenGL/Gradients?

This should backend to a C renderer or something.

\subsubsection configuration-data-ideas Configuration Data Ideas

Embroidermodder should boot from the command line regardless of whether it is or is not 
installed (this helps with testing and running on machines without root). Therefore, it can 
create an initiation file but it won't rely on its existence to boot: 
`~/.embroidermodder/config.json`.

* Switch colors to be stored as 6 digit hexcodes with a `#`.
* We've got close to a hand implemented ini read/write setup in `settings.py`.

\subsubsection section Distribution

When we release the new pip wheel we should also package:

* `.tar.gz` and `.zip` source archive.
* Debian package
* RPM package

Only do this once per minor version number.

\subsubsection scripting-overhaul Scripting Overhaul

Originally Embroidermodder had a terminal widget, this is why we removed it.

\todo Screenshot a working draft to demonstrate.

\subsubsection perennial-jobs Perennial Jobs

\todo (perennial) Check for memory leaks
\todo (perennial) Clear compiler warnings on `-Wall -ansi -pedantic` for C.
\todo (perennial) Write new tests for new code.
\todo (perennial) Get Embroidermodder onto the current version of libembroidery.
\todo (perennial) PEP7 compliance.
\todo (perennial) Better documentation with more photos/screencaps.

\subsubsection full-test-suite Full Test Suite

(This needs a hook from Embroidermodder to embroider's full test suite.)

The flag `--full-test-suite` runs all the tests that have been written.
Since this results in a lot of output the details are both to stdout
and to a text file called `test_matrix.txt`.

Patches that strictly improve the results in the `test_matrix.txt` over
the current version will likely be accepted and it'll be a good place
to go digging for contributions. (Note: strictly improve means that
the testing result for each test is as good a result, if not better.
Sacrificing one critera for another would require some design work
before we would consider it.)

\subsubsection symbols Symbols

Symbols use the SVG path syntax.

In theory, we could combine the icons and symbols systems, since they could be
rendered once and stored as icons in Qt. (Or as textures in FreeGLUT.)

Also we want to render the patterns themselves using SVG syntax, so it would
save on repeated work overall.

\subsection features Features

\subsubsection bindings Bindings

Bindings for libembroidery are maintained for the languages we use internally
in the project, for other languages we consider that the responsibility of
other teams using the library.

So libembroidery is going to be supported on:

* `C` (by default)
* `C++` (also by default)
* `Java` (for the Android application MobileViewer)
* `Swift` (for the iOS application iMobileViewer)

For `C#` we recommend directly calling the function directly
using the DllImport feature:

    [DllImport("libembroidery.so", EntryPoint="readCsv")]

see this StackOverflow discussion for help: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11425202/is-it-possible-to-call-a-c-function-from-c-net](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11425202/is-it-possible-to-call-a-c-function-from-c-net).

For Python you can do the same using ctypes: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-call-a-c-function-in-python/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-call-a-c-function-in-python/).

\subsection gui-design GUI Design

Embroidermodder 2 was written in C++/Qt5 and it was far too complex. We had issues with people
not able to build from source because the Qt5 libraries were so ungainly. So I decided to do a
rewrite in C/SDL2 (originally FreeGLUT, but that was a mistake) with data stored as YAML. This
means linking 4-7 libraries depending on your system which are all well supported and widely available.

This is going well, although it's slow progress as I'm trying to keep track of the design while
also doing a ground up rewrite. I don't want to throw away good ideas. Since I also write code
for libembroidery my time is divided.
Overview of the UI rewrite

(Problems to be solved in brackets.)

It's not much to look at because I'm trying to avoid using an external
widgets system, which in turn means writing things like toolbars and menubars
over. If you want to get the design the actuator is the heart of it.

Without Qt5 we need a way of assigning signals with actions, so this is what
I've got: the user interacts with a UI element, this sends an integer to the
actuator that does the thing using the current state of the mainwindow struct
of which we expect there to be exactly one instance. The action is taken out
by a jump table that calls the right function (most of which are missing in
action and not connected up properly). It also logs the number, along with
key parts of the main struct in the undo history (an unsolved problem because
we need to decide how much data to copy over per action). This means undo,
redo and repeat actions can refer to this data.

\subsectionTranslation of the user interface

In a given table the left column is the default symbol and the right string is the translation. 
If the translate function fails to find a translation it returns the default symbol.

So in US English it is an empty table, but in UK English
only the dialectical differences are present.

Ideally, we should support at least the 6 languages spoken at the UN. Quoting www.un.org:

> _There are six official languages of the UN. These are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish._

We're adding Hindi, on the grounds that it is one of the most commonly spoken languages and at 
least one of the Indian languages should be present.

Written Chinese is generally supported as two different symbol sets and we follow that 
convension.

English is supported as two dialects to ensure that the development team is aware of what those 
differences are. The code base is written by a mixture of US and UK native English speakers 
meaning that only the variable names are consistently one dialect: US English. As for 
documentation: it is whatever dialect the writer prefers (but they should maintain consistency 
within a text block like this one).

Finally, we have "default", which is the dominant language
of the internals of the software. Practically, this is
just US English, but in terms of programming history this
is the "C locale".

\seciton open-collective Open Collective and New Plan (2021-12-19)

Hi, welcome to our first update after switching to Open Collective.

I hope that we can get people excited about open software and hardware for embroidery again. Clearly there was some real talent and effort from Jonathon, Mark  and other contributors in making this happen. Hopefully, Josh and I can make these programs a standard fixture of garage workshops by making them easy to install, modify, build and distribute.

I've sketched out a timetable for the development of Embroidermodder, I feel I should share it with everyone:

| *Date* | *Event* |
|------|-------|
| _Dec 2021 - Jan 2022_ | libembroidery 1.0 features, particularly the basic file format support and fills Bugfixing, Testing, QA for libembroidery |
| _31st of Jan 2022_ | libembroidery 1.0 will be released, then updates will slow down and the Embroidermodder 2 development version will be fixed to the API of this version. |
| _Feb 2022_ | An overview of what has changed will be written up for the website as a news update Better documentation of libembroidery. |
| _Feb-April 2022_ | Finish the conversion to new GUI toolkit |
| _April-May 2022_ |  Finish all the targets in the Design, or assign them to 2.1. |
| _May-June 2022_ |  Stop pushing new features. Bugfixing, Testing, QA for Embroidermodder 2 |
| _Summer Solstice (21st of June) 2022_ | Embroidermodder 2 is officially released. Distribute NSIS installer, debian package, fedora package, mac bundle and source archives |
| _July 2022_ | News and Documentation work for Embroidermodder 2 |

_Embroidermodder 2_ is a zlib licensed software and we endevour to keep it free and well documented. Check out our [main github page](https://github.com/Embroidermodder/Embroidermodder) to see.

Cheers,

Robin

\section fast-forward Fast Forward (2014-02-13)

There have been some changes that happened over the past several months:

The launch of the Kickstarter campaign was delayed but is still going to happen. Unless there are other unforeseen setbacks,
the revised plan is to launch our campaign on March 17.

We have started setup of a nightly build/continuous integration system using Travis-CI.
This is important as it will allow quicker bug fixes and increased stability long term. Currently
this is only available for 64-bit Linux builds but will eventually include OSX, Windows and Arduino.

We have also improved the stability and improved the API of our backend library: libembroidery. The API is
still changing but we now can produce standalone static and shared versions of libembroidery. Another notable
change is that there are now experimental Delphi and Lazarus(FreePascal) bindings in the works for libembroidery, contributed by <a href="https://github.com/x2nie">x2nie</a>.

Last but not least, I have a demonstration of our libembroidery code embedded on an Arduino. The video below simulates the stitching
by drawing it to a 2.8" TFT display (v1) made by <a href="https://adafruit.com">Adafruit</a>. It's really fast so I slowed it down for the video.
Instead of drawing, we could change it to control motors and other hardware to create an open source embroidery machine.
This is what the brain of an embroidery machine looks like and it just needs a heart and body. Enjoy the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqiKfn4lxBk">video</a>!

\section jan22news January 2022 Development Notes For Embroidermodder 2 (2022-01-31)

Hi backers,

since the last update development has been focused on mostly not user-facing aspects of the program. This is what we planned in the timetable, aiming to release the libembroidery library for the end of the month.

The idea being that if we can fix an API for libembroidery early, it will focus development into a program that remains more consistent by the height of the Summer.

Unfortunately, this was too ambitious. But we can discuss what has changed, and why a later date is better than focusing on hitting this milestone.

\subsection broad-development-goals Broad Development Goals

We want:

 * A small codebase.
 * A separation of code and data in procedural style.
 * A separation of basic library functions from GUI code.
 * A build system without non-standard dependencies (i.e. not including windows.h, X11, GL).
 * A software that runs without installation
 * A software that can keep records of its state that can be loaded on reboot

To meet these goals we are making a C/FreeGLUT application:

 * Runs on more systems because it has less (and less high level) dependencies.
 * Requires less specialist knowledge from our potential new developers of Qt, C++ and the build system.
 * Compiles with less faff since the only dependencies are the graphics libraries of the host system (meeting broad development goal 4).

Other decisions made to meet these goals are detailed below.

\subsection new-settings-system The New Settings System

In the attempt to convert the mostly C++ codebase to C, we developed a basic system for storing the data of Embroidermodder (including all the icons) as a single JSON file weighing in at about 6Mb.

This allows the second broad development goal to be met.

\subsection reducing-reliance-on-qt5 Reducing Reliance on Qt5

The FreeGLUT variant of the code (in gui.c) will eventually be the software.

The broad development goals should make that very complex change a sequence of smaller, less complex changes. For example: breaking apart highly object-oriented code that relies on high level Qt function calls into data and code and then seperating out the code parts into C and C++ functions.

\subsection color-palettes Color Palettes

Using a custom script we converted all the icons into xpm, then using another reduced their palettes down to 16 colors + transparency.

This hasn't affected their appearance significantly, and makes making a global GUI palette feasible. With a global GUI palette we can make icon themes be a simple remap of the palette.

\subsection conclusion Conclusion

Overall, the software is easier to understand. But not easy enough for it to be worth committing to extensive documentation that will likely have to change. This also makes deciding on a API difficult.

Based on this, a short term aim can be writing more high level documentation like this update to clarify (even just to the team) why we made the decisions we have.

Cheers,

Robin Swift

\section June 2022 Backer Update (2022-06-22)

Hi backers,

since it's mainly me developing as a hobbyist at the moment successes are rare so I thought it would be good to share these with you.

\subsection working-fill-algorithm Working Fill Algorithms

I've managed to get two fills working from the command line using the commands:

```
$ embroider --fill input_image.ppm 130 output.dst
$ embroider --cross-stitch input_image.ppm 130 output.dst
```

So given this version of the banner logo:

![banner logo](images/logo.png)

It is cross-stitched like this:

![banner logo](images/crossstitch_logo.png)

There are major limitations, it requires an input that has depth 8 and is 1000x1000 pixels and it only takes in ppm format images. Your other format images could be converted to this format using:

```
$ convert input.png -depth 8 -geometry 1000x1000 output.ppm
```

A command like this will be embedded into the software to allow more image types but it would require the user to install imagemagick first.

Here's another example using the imagemagick wizard:

![stitching applied to imagemagick wizard](images/wizard_stitched.png)

\subsection working-render-algorithm Working Render Algorithm

The renders shown above were also made by the program using the commands:

```
$ embroider --render input.dst output.ppm
$ convert output.ppm output.png
```

\subsection timetable Timetable

As for the timetable, obviously that was too ambitious given the lack of a large team and the slow growth of interest. A tentative timetable is on the README, but that's uncertain as long as the major rewrite to C/SDL2 is underway, hopefully it'll still be a 2.0 release this year.

I'll try and share some more examples next month!

Cheers,

Robin

We have launched our crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter! It will be running until Sunday, April 20th. The way Kickstarter operates is that we need to reach our funding goal to receive any funds. There are downloads available for Windows (32-bit), Linux (32 and 64-bit), Mac OS X (64-bit) and Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) on the Kickstarter page. There has been a ton of work done to get to this point and to ensure a timely and stable delivery, this campaign needs to succeed. We really want to shake up the embroidery world and we hope you agree.

There has been a considerable amount of development time put into Embroidermodder 2 over the past several months.
To be able to keep up this momentum, there needs to be at least one full time developer working on it.
We are planning on launching a Kickstarter campaign in early October if everything goes according to plan.
We also plan to release an alpha version during this timeframe, so there are many good things on the horizon!
Successful funding will have a major impact on how soon the final version will be released.

The preview link to our campaign is <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redteam316/369640335?token=57f7685e">here</a>, feel free to leave feedback and spread the word via Twitter, Facebook, email, or word of mouth. Keep an eye out, because it's coming!

\section open-collective Open Collective and New Plan (2021-12-19)

Hi, welcome to our first update after switching to Open Collective.

I hope that we can get people excited about open software and hardware for embroidery again. Clearly there was some real talent and effort from Jonathon, Mark  and other contributors in making this happen. Hopefully, Josh and I can make these programs a standard fixture of garage workshops by making them easy to install, modify, build and distribute.

I've sketched out a timetable for the development of Embroidermodder, I feel I should share it with everyone:

| *Date* | *Event* |
|------|-------|
| _Dec 2021 - Jan 2022_ | libembroidery 1.0 features, particularly the basic file format support and fills Bugfixing, Testing, QA for libembroidery |
| _31st of Jan 2022_ | libembroidery 1.0 will be released, then updates will slow down and the Embroidermodder 2 development version will be fixed to the API of this version. |
| _Feb 2022_ | An overview of what has changed will be written up for the website as a news update Better documentation of libembroidery. |
| _Feb-April 2022_ | Finish the conversion to new GUI toolkit |
| _April-May 2022_ |  Finish all the targets in the Design, or assign them to 2.1. |
| _May-June 2022_ |  Stop pushing new features. Bugfixing, Testing, QA for Embroidermodder 2 |
| _Summer Solstice (21st of June) 2022_ | Embroidermodder 2 is officially released. Distribute NSIS installer, debian package, fedora package, mac bundle and source archives |
| _July 2022_ | News and Documentation work for Embroidermodder 2 |

_Embroidermodder 2_ is a zlib licensed software and we endevour to keep it free and well documented. Check out our [main github page](https://github.com/Embroidermodder/Embroidermodder) to see.

Cheers,

Robin

\section jan22news January 2022 Development Notes For Embroidermodder 2 (2022-01-31)

Hi backers,

since the last update development has been focused on mostly not user-facing aspects of the program. This is what we planned in the timetable, aiming to release the libembroidery library for the end of the month.

The idea being that if we can fix an API for libembroidery early, it will focus development into a program that remains more consistent by the height of the Summer.

Unfortunately, this was too ambitious. But we can discuss what has changed, and why a later date is better than focusing on hitting this milestone.

\subsection broad-development-goals Broad Development Goals

We want:

 * A small codebase.
 * A separation of code and data in procedural style.
 * A separation of basic library functions from GUI code.
 * A build system without non-standard dependencies (i.e. not including windows.h, X11, GL).
 * A software that runs without installation
 * A software that can keep records of its state that can be loaded on reboot

To meet these goals we are making a C/FreeGLUT application:

 * Runs on more systems because it has less (and less high level) dependencies.
 * Requires less specialist knowledge from our potential new developers of Qt, C++ and the build system.
 * Compiles with less faff since the only dependencies are the graphics libraries of the host system (meeting broad development goal 4).

Other decisions made to meet these goals are detailed below.

\subsection the-new-settings-system The New Settings System

In the attempt to convert the mostly C++ codebase to C, we developed a basic system for storing the data of Embroidermodder (including all the icons) as a single JSON file weighing in at about 6Mb.

This allows the second broad development goal to be met.

\subsection reducing-reliance-on-qt5 Reducing Reliance on Qt5

The FreeGLUT variant of the code (in gui.c) will eventually be the software.

The broad development goals should make that very complex change a sequence of smaller, less complex changes. For example: breaking apart highly object-oriented code that relies on high level Qt function calls into data and code and then seperating out the code parts into C and C++ functions.

\subsection Color Palettes

Using a custom script we converted all the icons into xpm, then using another reduced their palettes down to 16 colors + transparency.

This hasn't affected their appearance significantly, and makes making a global GUI palette feasible. With a global GUI palette we can make icon themes be a simple remap of the palette.

\subsection Conclusion

Overall, the software is easier to understand. But not easy enough for it to be worth committing to extensive documentation that will likely have to change. This also makes deciding on a API difficult.

Based on this, a short term aim can be writing more high level documentation like this update to clarify (even just to the team) why we made the decisions we have.

Cheers,

Robin Swift

\section jun22news June 2022 Backer Update (2022-06-22)

Hi backers,

since it's mainly me developing as a hobbyist at the moment successes are rare so I thought it would be good to share these with you.

\subsection Working Fill Algorithms

I've managed to get two fills working from the command line using the commands:

```
$ embroider --fill input_image.ppm 130 output.dst
$ embroider --cross-stitch input_image.ppm 130 output.dst
```

So given this version of the banner logo:

![banner logo](images/logo.png)

It is cross-stitched like this:

![banner logo](images/crossstitch_logo.png)

There are major limitations, it requires an input that has depth 8 and is 1000x1000 pixels and it only takes in ppm format images. Your other format images could be converted to this format using:

```
$ convert input.png -depth 8 -geometry 1000x1000 output.ppm
```

A command like this will be embedded into the software to allow more image types but it would require the user to install imagemagick first.

Here's another example using the imagemagick wizard:

![stitching applied to imagemagick wizard](images/wizard_stitched.png)

\subsection working-render-algorithm Working Render Algorithm

The renders shown above were also made by the program using the commands:

```
$ embroider --render input.dst output.ppm
$ convert output.ppm output.png
```

\subsection timetable Timetable

As for the timetable, obviously that was too ambitious given the lack of a large team and the slow growth of interest. A tentative timetable is on the README, but that's uncertain as long as the major rewrite to C/SDL2 is underway, hopefully it'll still be a 2.0 release this year.

I'll try and share some more examples next month!

Cheers,

Robin

\section fast-forward Fast Forward (2014-02-13)

There have been some changes that happened over the past several months:

The launch of the Kickstarter campaign was delayed but is still going to happen. Unless there are other unforeseen setbacks,
the revised plan is to launch our campaign on March 17.

We have started setup of a nightly build/continuous integration system using Travis-CI.
This is important as it will allow quicker bug fixes and increased stability long term. Currently
this is only available for 64-bit Linux builds but will eventually include OSX, Windows and Arduino.

We have also improved the stability and improved the API of our backend library: libembroidery. The API is
still changing but we now can produce standalone static and shared versions of libembroidery. Another notable
change is that there are now experimental Delphi and Lazarus(FreePascal) bindings in the works for libembroidery, contributed by <a href="https://github.com/x2nie">x2nie</a>.

Last but not least, I have a demonstration of our libembroidery code embedded on an Arduino. The video below simulates the stitching
by drawing it to a 2.8" TFT display (v1) made by <a href="https://adafruit.com">Adafruit</a>. It's really fast so I slowed it down for the video.
Instead of drawing, we could change it to control motors and other hardware to create an open source embroidery machine.
This is what the brain of an embroidery machine looks like and it just needs a heart and body. Enjoy the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqiKfn4lxBk">video</a>!
