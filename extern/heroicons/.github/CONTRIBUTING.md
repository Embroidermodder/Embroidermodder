## Publishing

This section is intended only for the project maintainers.

1. Increment the version number in the `package.json`, `./react/package.json` and `./vue/package.json` files, and run `npm install` from the project root to update `package-lock.json`.
2. Update the changelog.
3. Commit and tag those changes.
4. Push the commit and tag to GitHub.
5. Review the draft release generated by GitHub.
6. Publish the new release on GitHub. This will automatically trigger a GitHub action to publish these packages to NPM.
