\textbackslash{}seciton open-\/collective Open Collective and New Plan (2021-\/12-\/19)

Hi, welcome to our first update after switching to Open Collective.

I hope that we can get people excited about open software and hardware for embroidery again. Clearly there was some real talent and effort from Jonathon, Mark and other contributors in making this happen. Hopefully, Josh and I can make these programs a standard fixture of garage workshops by making them easy to install, modify, build and distribute.

I\textquotesingle{}ve sketched out a timetable for the development of Embroidermodder, I feel I should share it with everyone\+:

There have been some changes that happened over the past several months\+:

The launch of the Kickstarter campaign was delayed but is still going to happen. Unless there are other unforeseen setbacks, the revised plan is to launch our campaign on March 17.

We have started setup of a nightly build/continuous integration system using Travis-\/\+CI. This is important as it will allow quicker bug fixes and increased stability long term. Currently this is only available for 64-\/bit Linux builds but will eventually include OSX, Windows and Arduino.

We have also improved the stability and improved the API of our backend library\+: libembroidery. The API is still changing but we now can produce standalone static and shared versions of libembroidery. Another notable change is that there are now experimental Delphi and Lazarus(\+Free\+Pascal) bindings in the works for libembroidery, contributed by \href{https://github.com/x2nie}{\texttt{ x2nie}}.

Last but not least, I have a demonstration of our libembroidery code embedded on an Arduino. The video below simulates the stitching by drawing it to a 2.\+8\char`\"{} TFT display (v1) made by $<$a href=\char`\"{}\href{https://adafruit.com}{\texttt{ https\+://adafruit.\+com}}"{}$>$Adafruit. It\textquotesingle{}s really fast so I slowed it down for the video. Instead of drawing, we could change it to control motors and other hardware to create an open source embroidery machine. This is what the brain of an embroidery machine looks like and it just needs a heart and body.

Hi backers,

since the last update development has been focused on mostly not user-\/facing aspects of the program. This is what we planned in the timetable, aiming to release the libembroidery library for the end of the month.

The idea being that if we can fix an API for libembroidery early, it will focus development into a program that remains more consistent by the height of the Summer.

Unfortunately, this was too ambitious. But we can discuss what has changed, and why a later date is better than focusing on hitting this milestone.\hypertarget{post-history_broad-development-goals}{}\doxysubsubsection{Broad Development Goals}\label{post-history_broad-development-goals}
We want\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A small codebase.
\item A separation of code and data in procedural style.
\item A separation of basic library functions from GUI code.
\item A build system without non-\/standard dependencies (i.\+e. not including windows.\+h, X11, GL).
\item A software that runs without installation
\item A software that can keep records of its state that can be loaded on reboot
\end{DoxyItemize}

To meet these goals we are making a C/\+Free\+GLUT application\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Runs on more systems because it has less (and less high level) dependencies.
\item Requires less specialist knowledge from our potential new developers of Qt, C++ and the build system.
\item Compiles with less faff since the only dependencies are the graphics libraries of the host system (meeting broad development goal 4).
\end{DoxyItemize}

Other decisions made to meet these goals are detailed below.\hypertarget{post-history_new-settings-system}{}\doxysubsubsection{The New Settings System}\label{post-history_new-settings-system}
In the attempt to convert the mostly C++ codebase to C, we developed a basic system for storing the data of Embroidermodder (including all the icons) as a single JSON file weighing in at about 6Mb.

This allows the second broad development goal to be met.\hypertarget{post-history_reducing-reliance-on-qt5}{}\doxysubsubsection{Reducing Reliance on Qt5}\label{post-history_reducing-reliance-on-qt5}
The Free\+GLUT variant of the code (in gui.\+c) will eventually be the software.

The broad development goals should make that very complex change a sequence of smaller, less complex changes. For example\+: breaking apart highly object-\/oriented code that relies on high level Qt function calls into data and code and then seperating out the code parts into C and C++ functions.\hypertarget{post-history_color-palettes}{}\doxysubsubsection{Color Palettes}\label{post-history_color-palettes}
Using a custom script we converted all the icons into xpm, then using another reduced their palettes down to 16 colors + transparency.

This hasn\textquotesingle{}t affected their appearance significantly, and makes making a global GUI palette feasible. With a global GUI palette we can make icon themes be a simple remap of the palette.\hypertarget{post-history_conclusion}{}\doxysubsubsection{Conclusion}\label{post-history_conclusion}
Overall, the software is easier to understand. But not easy enough for it to be worth committing to extensive documentation that will likely have to change. This also makes deciding on a API difficult.

Based on this, a short term aim can be writing more high level documentation like this update to clarify (even just to the team) why we made the decisions we have.

Cheers,

Robin Swift

Hi backers,

since it\textquotesingle{}s mainly me developing as a hobbyist at the moment successes are rare so I thought it would be good to share these with you.\hypertarget{post-history_working-fill-algorithm}{}\doxysubsubsection{Working Fill Algorithms}\label{post-history_working-fill-algorithm}
I\textquotesingle{}ve managed to get two fills working from the command line using the commands\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ embroider -\/-\/fill input\_image.ppm 130 output.dst}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ embroider -\/-\/cross-\/stitch input\_image.ppm 130 output.dst}

\end{DoxyCode}


So given this version of the banner logo\+:



It is cross-\/stitched like this\+:



There are major limitations, it requires an input that has depth 8 and is 1000x1000 pixels and it only takes in ppm format images. Your other format images could be converted to this format using\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ convert input.png -\/depth 8 -\/geometry 1000x1000 output.ppm}

\end{DoxyCode}


A command like this will be embedded into the software to allow more image types but it would require the user to install imagemagick first.

Here\textquotesingle{}s another example using the imagemagick wizard\+:

\hypertarget{post-history_working-render-algorithm}{}\doxysubsubsection{Working Render Algorithm}\label{post-history_working-render-algorithm}
The renders shown above were also made by the program using the commands\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ embroider -\/-\/render input.dst output.ppm}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ convert output.ppm output.png}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{post-history_timetable}{}\doxysubsubsection{Timetable}\label{post-history_timetable}
As for the timetable, obviously that was too ambitious given the lack of a large team and the slow growth of interest. A tentative timetable is on the README, but that\textquotesingle{}s uncertain as long as the major rewrite to C/\+SDL2 is underway, hopefully it\textquotesingle{}ll still be a 2.\+0 release this year.

I\textquotesingle{}ll try and share some more examples next month!

Cheers,

Robin
