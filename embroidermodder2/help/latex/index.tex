Embroidermodder is a free machine embroidery application. The newest version, Embroidermodder 2 can\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item edit and create embroidery designs
\item estimate the amount of thread and machine time needed to stitch a design
\item convert embroidery files to a variety of formats
\item upscale or downscale designs
\item run on Windows, Mac and Linux
\end{DoxyItemize}

Embroidermodder 2 is very much a work in progress since we\textquotesingle{}re doing a ground up rewrite to an interface in C using the GUI toolkit SDL2. The reasoning for this is detailed in the issues tab.

For a more in-\/depth look at what we are developing read our \href{https://www.libembroidery.org}{\texttt{ website}} which includes these docs as well as the up-\/to date printer-\/friendly versions. These discuss recent changes, plans and has user and developer guides for all the Embroidermodder projects.
