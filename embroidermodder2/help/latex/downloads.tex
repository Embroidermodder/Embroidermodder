This is a highly experimental build\+: we recommend users wait for the beta release when the basic features are functional.

Visit our \href{https://github.com/Embroidermodder/Embroidermodder/releases}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub Releases page}} for the current build. Unfortunately, earlier builds went down with the Sourceforge page we hosted them on.
