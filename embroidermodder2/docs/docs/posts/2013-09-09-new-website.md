The Embroidermodder website now has a fresh new look. The content has been updated to reflect the upcoming version, Embroidermodder 2.
Check out our <a href="features.html">features page</a> for a summary of what to expect with Embroidermodder 2.

The background is a tiled image of an actual design that was stitched out during the pre-alpha stage.
It was created by Nina Paley and Theodore Gray using Mathematica in conjunction with our software.
They have graciously allowed us to use it for the project in whichever way we wish. We thought it looked so good, that it has become the new theme for Embroidermodder 2.
To check out some of the more interesting embroidery projects they are working on, <a href="http://blog.ninapaley.com/">look here</a>. 

The old website which was for Embroidermodder 1 has been preserved and can be found <a href="http://embroidermodder.sourceforge.net/embroidermodder1.html">here</a> for anyone interested.
