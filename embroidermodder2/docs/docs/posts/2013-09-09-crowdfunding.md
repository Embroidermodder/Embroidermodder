There has been a considerable amount of development time put into Embroidermodder 2 over the past several months.
To be able to keep up this momentum, there needs to be at least one full time developer working on it.
We are planning on launching a Kickstarter campaign in early October if everything goes according to plan.
We also plan to release an alpha version during this timeframe, so there are many good things on the horizon!
Successful funding will have a major impact on how soon the final version will be released.

The preview link to our campaign is <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redteam316/369640335?token=57f7685e">here</a>, feel free to leave feedback and spread the word via Twitter, Facebook, email, or word of mouth. Keep an eye out, because it's coming!
