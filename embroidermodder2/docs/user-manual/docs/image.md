# Full Colour Photograph, Vector and Black and White Designs

WARNING: THIS FEATURE IS NOT AT ALL PRESENT, THIS SECTION IS PLANNING.

If you are starting an embroidery from an image, it's important to note that \embname uses very different
approaches based on what kind of image is fed into it. A photograph is the most difficult starting point
for an automated system since there are many artistic decisions which are mutually exclusive and
no software should make those decisions for you. At least, you should be aware that a decision is being made.
On the other hand, a vector based design gives the program the best starting point while still not being
a machine embroidery file. Finally a scan of a vector image or hand-drawn inkwork is somewhere in-between
these options and is the recommended option for people who work best on paper.

The following subsections are in order of how good the final results should be.
