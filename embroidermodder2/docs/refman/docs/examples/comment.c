/* Use C Style Comments within code blocks.
 *
 * Use Doxygen style code blocks to place todo, bug, hack, warning,
 * and note items like this:
 *
 * \todo EXAMPLE: This code clearly needs more work or further review.
 *
 * \bug This code is definitely wrong. It needs fixed.
 *
 * \hack This code shouldn't be written this way or I don't
 * feel right about it. There may a better solution
 *
 * \warning Think twice (or more times) before changing this code.
 * I put this here for a good reason.
 *
 * \note This comment is much more important than lesser comments.
