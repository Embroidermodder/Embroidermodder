The Brevity Branch
------------------

This branch is an experiment in making a more compact, easier to understand version
of embroidermodder. First, rather than parsing data from configuration at boot,
we compile all data into the executable. This means that the code required to
process this data isn't necessary, we don't need to check the file is present
and we don't need to vet the data for correctness after parsing since it is
definitely formatted as we expected.

Next, rather than attempting to keep the total number of source lines of code
to a managable size, we focus on the number of lines of code not generated by
a program. XPM images are C code generated by imagemagick's "convert" utility
and therefore only the script that generates them and the assets are what we
maintain.

Next, shipping the program can be as simple as downloading a single file,
similar to, say, Rufus. Which means that updating the software means just
replacing this single file and we don't need to carefully contruct an
archive tuned to each system.

Finally, internal scripting is no longer necessary beyond the overall state
of the program. Instead our command history approach where all user actions
are encoded into commands and a sequence of commands is all that is needed:
if the user wishes to loop a sequence of commands they can write a script
that produces a runcommand style file to be pasted into embroidermodder
that unrolls the loop. Or even, write a new program that calls libembroidery.
