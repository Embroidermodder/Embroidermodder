Introduction
============

The **Embroidermodder 2** project is a collection of small software utilities for
manipulating, converting and creating embroidery files in all major embroidery
machine formats. The program **Embroidermodder 2** itself is a larger graphical
user interface (GUI) which is at the heart of the project.

This manual, the website (``libembroidery.org``), mobile embroidery format viewers
and tools (``iMobileViewer``, ``MobileViewer``), the core library of functions
(``libembroidery``) and CLI (``needle``) are all tools to make the standard
user experience of working with an embroidery machine better without expensive
software which is locked to specific manufacturers and formats. But ultimately
we hope that the core *Embroidermodder 2* is a practical, ever-present tool in
larger workshops, small cottage industry workshops and personal hobbyist's
bedrooms.

Embroidermodder 2 is licensed under the zlib license and we aim to keep all of
our tools open source and free of charge. If you would like to support the
project check out our Open Collective group. If you would like to help, please
join us on GitHub. This document is written as developer training as well
helping new users (see the last sections) so this is the place to learn how
to start changing the code.

The Embroidermodder Project and Team
------------------------------------

The tools and associated documents are:

#. The website https://www.libembroidery.org
#. This reference manual covering the development of all these projects with
   the current, printable version available here:
   https://www.libembroidery.org/emrm_current.pdf
#. The GUI **Embroidermodder 2** covered in Chapter~\ref{GUI}.
#. The core library of low-level functions: ``libembroidery``,
   covered in Chapter~\ref{libembroidery}
#. The CLI `embroider`, which is part of libembroidery
#. Mobile embroidery format viewers and tools convered in Chapter~\ref{Mobile}.
#. Specs for an open source hardware embroidery machine extension called the
   Portable Embroidery Tool (PET) which is also part of libembroidery.
   See Chapter~\ref{PET}.

The website, this manual and some scripts to construct the distribution are
maintained in %\citep{thewebsite}.

They all tools to make the standard
user experience of working with an embroidery machine better without expensive
software which is locked to specific manufacturers and formats. But ultimately
we hope that the core *Embroidermodder 2* is a practical, ever-present tool in
larger workshops, small cottage industry workshops and personal hobbyist's

The Embroidermodder Team is the collection of people who've submitted
patches, artwork and documentation to our three projects.
The team was established by Jonathan Greig and Josh Varga.
The full list is actively maintained below.
