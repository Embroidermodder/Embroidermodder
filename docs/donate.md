Creating software that interfaces with hardware is costly. A summary of some of the costs involved:
                    
  * Developer time for 2 core developers
  * Computer equipment and parts
  * Embroidery machinery
  * Various electronics
  * Consumable materials (thread, fabric, stabilizer, etc...)
