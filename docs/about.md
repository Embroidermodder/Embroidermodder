## History

Embroidermodder 1 was started by Mark Pontius in 2004 while staying up all night with his son in his first couple months. When Mark returned 
to his day job, he lacked the time to continue the project. Mark made the decision to focus on his family and work, and in 
2005, Mark gave full control of the project to Josh Varga so that Embroidermodder could continue its growth.

Embroidermodder 2 was conceived in mid 2011 when Jonathan Greig and Josh Varga discussed the possibility of making a cross-platform version.
It is currently in active development and will run on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows and Raspberry Pi.
