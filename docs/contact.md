# Contact

During this alpha development stage the user documentation isn't going to be reliable. So if you're interested
in using the software in the future and have specific requests, post an issue
[here](https://github.com/Embroidermodder/embroidermodder/issues).

If you are interested in development: open an issue [here](https://github.com/Embroidermodder/refman/issues).

If you have software you want to interface with the underlying algorithms of Embroidermodder, go
[here](https://github.com/embroidermodder/libembroidery).

If you have more general queries about how to engage with the project or this website, open an issue on
[the website issue page](https://github.com/Embroidermodder/website/issues).

Lastly, we have a googlemail which is not listed here to reduce spam: it can be found in the
[documentation](https://www.libembroidery.org/documentation).
