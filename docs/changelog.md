# Changelog

This changelog records from the beta release onwards. For the
pre-release notes on why the software has the design it does
see the [reference manual](https://github.com/embroidermodder/refman).

Since most of the readers of this document are users of the software
needing to know how their workflow is affected, this is distributed
with the embroidermodder whereas the reference manual is not.

For the changes to libembroidery, the changelog is written into
`embroider`: use the command `embroider --changes`. For changes to
PET see this [changelog.md](https://github.com/embroidermodder/pet/main/blob/changelog.md).

(To be started.)
