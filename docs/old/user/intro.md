# Embroidermodder 2.0.0-alpha4  User Manual

## Introduction

!!! warning
    THIS MANUAL IS IN PROGRESS: PLEASE WAIT FOR THE BETA RELEASE.

This manual is for the various ways of using the \embname tools for designing,
editing and converting machine embroidery files. Most users should try loading and altering a design
in \embname itself before trying any of our conversion tools, our embedded system
or the command line interface. Advice on this is in the next section.

If you wish to write your own
software that uses these tools you will need the \embname Reference Manual (this
includes the API documentation). This is maintained at the permalink
\url{https://www.libembroidery.org/downloads/emrm.pdf}.
