# Embroidermodder 2.0.0-alpha User Manual

(IN ALPHA DEVELOPMENT: NOT READY FOR SERIOUS USE.)

Embroidermodder is a free machine embroidery software program.
The newest version, Embroidermodder 2 can:

- edit and create embroidery designs
- estimate the amount of thread and machine time needed to stitch a design
- convert embroidery files to a variety of formats
- upscale or downscale designs
- run on Windows, Mac and Linux

To try out the software in alpha see our current
[alpha pre-release](https://github.com/Embroidermodder/Embroidermodder/releases).

Various sample embroidery design files can be found in
the embroidermodder2/samples folder.

## Screenshots

If you use multiple operating systems, it's important to choose software that works on all of them.

Embroidermodder 2 runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Let's not forget the [Raspberry
Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org).

### Realistic Rendering

(This feature is currently broken.)

It is important to be able to visualize what a design will look like when stitched and our
pseudo ``3D'' realistic rendering helps achieve this.

Various grid types and auto-adjusting rulers

Making use of the automatically adjusting ruler in conjunction with the grid will ensure your
design is properly sized and fits within your embroidery hoop area.

Use rectangular, circular or isometric grids to construct your masterpiece!

### Many measurement tools

Taking measurements is a critical part of creating great designs. Whether you are designing
mission critical embroidered space suits for NASA or some other far out design for your next
meet-up, you will have precise measurement tools at your command to make it happen. You can
locate individual points or find distances between any 2 points anywhere in the design!

Take quick and accurate measurements:

### Add text to any design

Need to make company apparel for all of your employees with individual names on them? No sweat.
Just simply add text to your existing design or create one from scratch, quickly and easily.
Didn't get it the right size or made a typo? No problem. Just select the text and update it
with the property editor.

Add text and adjust its properties quickly:

### Supports many formats

Embroidery machines all accept different formats. There are so many formats available that it
can sometimes be confusing whether a design will work with your machine.

Embroidermodder 2 supports a wide variety of embroidery formats as well as several vector
formats, such as SVG and DXF. This allows you to worry less about which designs you can use.

### Batch Conversion

(Currently this being ported to the `embroider` command line program.)

Need to send a client several different formats? Just use libembroidery-convert, our command
line utility which supports batch file conversion.

There are a multitude of formats to choose from:

### Scripting API

The GUI works by emitting internal text commands, so if you want to alter
or add features to the program that aren't as low level as these commands then you
can chain them together in simple scripts. This allows more control over the program than
the GUI can offer.
