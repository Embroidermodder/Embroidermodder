<h2 id="january-2022-development-notes-for-embroidermodder-2">January 2022 Development Notes For Embroidermodder 2</h2>
<p>31st of January, 2022</p>
<p>Hi backers,</p>
<p>since the last update development has been focused on mostly not user-facing aspects of the program. This is what we planned in the timetable, aiming to release the libembroidery library for the end of the month.</p>
<p>The idea being that if we can fix an API for libembroidery early, it will focus development into a program that remains more consistent by the height of the Summer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was too ambitious. But we can discuss what has changed, and why a later date is better than focusing on hitting this milestone.</p>
<h3 id="broad-development-goals">Broad Development Goals</h3>
<p>We want:</p>
<ul>
<li>A small codebase.</li>
<li>A separation of code and data in procedural style.</li>
<li>A separation of basic library functions from GUI code.</li>
<li>A build system without non-standard dependencies (i.e. not including windows.h, X11, GL).</li>
<li>A software that runs without installation</li>
<li>A software that can keep records of its state that can be loaded on reboot</li>
</ul>
<p>To meet these goals we are making a C/FreeGLUT application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runs on more systems because it has less (and less high level) dependencies.</li>
<li>Requires less specialist knowledge from our potential new developers of Qt, C++ and the build system.</li>
<li>Compiles with less faff since the only dependencies are the graphics libraries of the host system (meeting broad development goal 4).</li>
</ul>
<p>Other decisions made to meet these goals are detailed below.</p>
<h3 id="the-new-settings-system">The New Settings System</h3>
<p>In the attempt to convert the mostly C++ codebase to C, we developed a basic system for storing the data of Embroidermodder (including all the icons) as a single JSON file weighing in at about 6Mb.</p>
<p>This allows the second broad development goal to be met.</p>
<h3 id="reducing-reliance-on-qt5">Reducing Reliance on Qt5</h3>
<p>The FreeGLUT variant of the code (in gui.c) will eventually be the software.</p>
<p>The broad development goals should make that very complex change a sequence of smaller, less complex changes. For example: breaking apart highly object-oriented code that relies on high level Qt function calls into data and code and then seperating out the code parts into C and C++ functions.</p>
<h3 id="color-palettes">Color Palettes</h3>
<p>Using a custom script we converted all the icons into xpm, then using another reduced their palettes down to 16 colors + transparency.</p>
<p>This hasn’t affected their appearance significantly, and makes making a global GUI palette feasible. With a global GUI palette we can make icon themes be a simple remap of the palette.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, the software is easier to understand. But not easy enough for it to be worth committing to extensive documentation that will likely have to change. This also makes deciding on a API difficult.</p>
<p>Based on this, a short term aim can be writing more high level documentation like this update to clarify (even just to the team) why we made the decisions we have.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Robin Swift</p>

<h2 id="open-collective-and-new-plan">Open Collective and New Plan</h2>
<p>19th of December, 2021</p>
<p>Hi, welcome to our first update after switching to Open Collective.</p>
<p>I hope that we can get people excited about open software and hardware for embroidery again. Clearly there was some real talent and effort from Jonathon, Mark and other contributors in making this happen. Hopefully, Josh and I can make these programs a standard fixture of garage workshops by making them easy to install, modify, build and distribute.</p>
<p>I’ve sketched out a timetable for the development of Embroidermodder, I feel I should share it with everyone:</p>

<p>We have launched our crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter! It will be running until Sunday, April 20th. The way Kickstarter operates is that we need to reach our funding goal to receive any funds. There are downloads available for Windows (32-bit), Linux (32 and 64-bit), Mac OS X (64-bit) and Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) on the Kickstarter page. There has been a ton of work done to get to this point and to ensure a timely and stable delivery, this campaign needs to succeed. We really want to shake up the embroidery world and we hope you agree. The link to our campaign is: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redteam316/embroidermodder-2-for-windows-mac-linux-pi-and-ard">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redteam316/embroidermodder-2-for-windows-mac-linux-pi-and-ard</a></p>

<h2 id="fast-forward">Fast Forward</h2>
<p>February 13, 2014</p>
<p>There have been some changes that happened over the past several months:</p>
<p>The launch of the Kickstarter campaign was delayed but is still going to happen. Unless there are other unforeseen setbacks, the revised plan is to launch our campaign on March 17.</p>
<p>We have started setup of a nightly build/continuous integration system using Travis-CI. This is important as it will allow quicker bug fixes and increased stability long term. Currently this is only available for 64-bit Linux builds but will eventually include OSX, Windows and Arduino.</p>
<p>We have also improved the stability and improved the API of our backend library: libembroidery. The API is still changing but we now can produce standalone static and shared versions of libembroidery. Another notable change is that there are now experimental Delphi and Lazarus(FreePascal) bindings in the works for libembroidery, contributed by <a href="https://github.com/x2nie">x2nie</a>.</p>
Last but not least, I have a demonstration of our libembroidery code embedded on an Arduino. The video below simulates the stitching by drawing it to a 2.8" TFT display (v1) made by <a href="https://adafruit.com">Adafruit</a>. It’s really fast so I slowed it down for the video. Instead of drawing, we could change it to control motors and other hardware to create an open source embroidery machine. This is what the brain of an embroidery machine looks like and it just needs a heart and body. Enjoy the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqiKfn4lxBk">video</a>!

<h2 id="crowdfunding-campaign-coming-soon">Crowdfunding Campaign Coming Soon!</h2>
<p>September 9, 2013</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redteam316/369640335?token=57f7685e"><img class="img" src="images/kickstarter/kickstarter-logo-dark.png" alt="Kickstarter Logo" /></a></p>
<p>There has been a considerable amount of development time put into Embroidermodder 2 over the past several months. To be able to keep up this momentum, there needs to be at least one full time developer working on it. We are planning on launching a Kickstarter campaign in early October if everything goes according to plan. We also plan to release an alpha version during this timeframe, so there are many good things on the horizon! Successful funding will have a major impact on how soon the final version will be released.</p>
<p>The preview link to our campaign is <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redteam316/369640335?token=57f7685e">here</a>, feel free to leave feedback and spread the word via Twitter, Facebook, email, or word of mouth. Keep an eye out, because it’s coming!</p>

<h2 id="new-website">New Website!</h2>
<p>September 9, 2013</p>
<p>The Embroidermodder website now has a fresh new look. The content has been updated to reflect the upcoming version, Embroidermodder 2. Check out our <a href="features.html">features page</a> for a summary of what to expect with Embroidermodder 2.</p>
<p>The background is a tiled image of an actual design that was stitched out during the pre-alpha stage. It was created by Nina Paley and Theodore Gray using Mathematica in conjunction with our software. They have graciously allowed us to use it for the project in whichever way we wish. We thought it looked so good, that it has become the new theme for Embroidermodder 2. To check out some of the more interesting embroidery projects they are working on, <a href="http://blog.ninapaley.com/">look here</a>.</p>
<p>The old website which was for Embroidermodder 1 has been preserved and can be found <a href="http://embroidermodder.sourceforge.net/embroidermodder1.html">here</a> for anyone interested.</p>
