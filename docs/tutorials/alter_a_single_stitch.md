# Alter a Single Stitch

In this tutorial we cover the scenarios where:

1. you have a design that you want to move a few points in but make no major changes
2. you have a design that you want to remove a few stitches from
3. you have a design that has some stitches in the wrong colour

In all cases, open Embroidermodder 2 and use `File > Open` to get the open file dialog.

(TO BE COMPLETED.)
