We have launched our crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter! It will be running until Sunday, April 20th. The way Kickstarter operates is that we need to reach our funding goal to receive any funds. There are downloads available for Windows (32-bit), Linux (32 and 64-bit), Mac OS X (64-bit) and Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) on the Kickstarter page. There has been a ton of work done to get to this point and to ensure a timely and stable delivery, this campaign needs to succeed. We really want to shake up the embroidery world and we hope you agree.
