Hi, welcome to our first update after switching to Open Collective.

I hope that we can get people excited about open software and hardware for embroidery again. Clearly there was some real talent and effort from Jonathon, Mark  and other contributors in making this happen. Hopefully, Josh and I can make these programs a standard fixture of garage workshops by making them easy to install, modify, build and distribute.

I've sketched out a timetable for the development of Embroidermodder, I feel I should share it with everyone:

| *Date* | *Event* |
|------|-------|
| _Dec 2021 - Jan 2022_ | libembroidery 1.0 features, particularly the basic file format support and fills Bugfixing, Testing, QA for libembroidery |
| _31st of Jan 2022_ | libembroidery 1.0 will be released, then updates will slow down and the Embroidermodder 2 development version will be fixed to the API of this version. |
| _Feb 2022_ | An overview of what has changed will be written up for the website as a news update Better documentation of libembroidery. |
| _Feb-April 2022_ | Finish the conversion to new GUI toolkit |
| _April-May 2022_ |  Finish all the targets in the Design, or assign them to 2.1. |
| _May-June 2022_ |  Stop pushing new features. Bugfixing, Testing, QA for Embroidermodder 2 |
| _Summer Solstice (21st of June) 2022_ | Embroidermodder 2 is officially released. Distribute NSIS installer, debian package, fedora package, mac bundle and source archives |
| _July 2022_ | News and Documentation work for Embroidermodder 2 |

_Embroidermodder 2_ is a zlib licensed software and we endevour to keep it free and well documented. Check out our [main github page](https://github.com/Embroidermodder/Embroidermodder) to see.

Cheers,

Robin
