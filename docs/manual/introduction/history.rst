Embroidermodder 1
-----------------

The Embroidermodder Team is also inspired by the original Embroidermodder that
was built by Mark Pontius and the same Josh Varga on SourceForge which
unfortunately appears to have died from linkrot. We may create a distribution
on here to be the official ``legacy`` Embroidermodder code but likely in a
seperate repository because it's GNU GPL v3 and this code is written to be
zlib (that is, permissive licensed) all the way down.

One reason why this is useful is that the rewrite by Jonathan Greig, John Varga
and Robin Swift for Embroidermodder 2 should have no regressions: no features
present in v1 should be missing in v2.
