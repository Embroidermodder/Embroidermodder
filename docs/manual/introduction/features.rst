Features
========

.. warning::

   This description is planning and these features are at varying stages of
   functionality.

Embroidermodder 2 has many advanced features that enable you to create awesome designs quicker, tweak existing designs to perfection, and can be fully customized to fit your workflow.

A summary of these features:

* Cross Platform
* Realistic rendering
* Various grid types and auto-adjusting rulers
* Many measurement tools
* Add text to any design
* Supports many formats
* Batch Conversion
* Scripting API

Cross Platform
--------------

If you use multiple operating systems, it's important to choose software that
works on all of them.

Embroidermodder 2 runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Let's not forget the
Raspberry Pi (https://www.raspberrypi.org).

Realistic Rendering
-------------------

It is important to be able to visualize what a design will look like when stitched and our
pseudo ``3D`` realistic rendering helps achieve this
%(see Figure~\ref{real-render}).

Real render examples.

Various grid types and auto-adjusting rulers
--------------------------------------------

Making use of the automatically adjusting ruler in conjunction with the
grid will ensure your design is properly sized and fits within your embroidery
hoop area.

Use rectangular, circular or isometric grids to construct your masterpiece!

Many measurement tools
----------------------

Taking measurements is a critical part of creating great designs. Whether you
are designing mission critical embroidered space suits for NASA or some other
far out design for your next meet-up, you will have precise measurement tools
at your command to make it happen. You can locate individual points or find
distances between any 2 points anywhere in the design!

Take quick and accurate measurements:

Add text to any design
----------------------

Need to make company apparel for all of your employees with individual names on
them? No sweat. Just simply add text to your existing design or create one from
scratch, quickly and easily.
Didn't get it the right size or made a typo? No problem. Just select the text and update it
with the property editor.

Add text and adjust its properties quickly:

\subsection{Supports many formats}

Embroidery machines all accept different formats. There are so many formats
available that it can sometimes be confusing whether a design will work with your machine.

Embroidermodder 2 supports a wide variety of embroidery formats as well as several vector
formats, such as SVG and DXF. This allows you to worry less about which designs you can use.

Batch Conversion
----------------

Need to send a client several different formats? Just use libembroidery-convert, our command
line utility which supports batch file conversion.

There are a multitude of formats to choose from:

\subsection{Scripting API}

If you've got programming skills and there is a feature that isn't currently available that you
absolutely cannot live without, you have the capability to create your own custom commands for
Embroidermodder 2. We provide an QtScript API which exposes various application functionality
so that it is possible to extend the application without requiring a new release. If you have
created a command that you think is worth including in the next release, just  contact
us (contact.html) and we will review it for functionality, bugs, and finally inclusion.
