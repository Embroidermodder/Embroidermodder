\chapter{Planning}

\item Smoothieboard experiments
\end{itemize}

\subsection{libembroidery-tests To-Do}

\begin{itemize}
\item looping test that reads 10 times while running valgrind. See \texttt{embPattern\_loadExternalColorFile()} Arduino leak note for more info.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Documentation To-Do}

\begin{itemize}
\item Document all tests.
\item Automation of tests.
\item Ensure that the stitch count matches what we know the file has
\end{itemize}

\subsection{2.x/Ideas}

\begin{itemize}
\item Cut/copy allow post-selection.
\item Layout into config.
\item beta
\item Get undo history widget back (BUG).
\item GUI frontend for embroider features that aren't supported by embroidermodder: flag selector from a table
\item Update all formats without color to check for edr or rgb files.
\item Setting for reverse scrolling direction (for zoom, vertical pan)
\item New embroidermodder2.ico 16x16 logo that looks good at that scale.
\item Saving dst, pes, jef.
\item Trim jumps over a certain length.
\item FAQ about setting high number of jumps for more controlled trimming.
\item Minimum stitch length option. (Many machines also have this option too)
\item Add 'Design Details' functionality to libembroidery-convert
\item Add 'Batch convert many to one format' functionality to libembroidery-convert
\item EmbroideryFLOSS - Color picker that displays catalog numbers and names.
\item Settings dialog: notify when the user is switching tabs that the setting has been changed, adding apply button is what would make sense for this to happen.
\item Update language translations.
\item Replace KDE4 thumbnailer.
\item Import raster image.
\item Notify user of data loss if not saving to an object format.
\item Add which formats to work with to preferences.
\item Cannot open file with `\#` in the name when opening multiple files but works with opening a single file.
\item Closing settings dialog with the X in the window saves settings rather than discarding them.
\item Otto theme icons: units, render, selectors, what's this icon doesn't scale.
\item Layer manager and Layer switcher dock widget.
\item Test that all formats read data in correct scale (format details should match other programs).
\item Custom filter bug -- doesn't save changes in some cases.
\item Tools to find common problems in the source code and suggest fixes to the developers. For example, a translation miss: that is, for any language other than English a missing entry in the translation table should supply a clear warning to developers.
\item Converting Qt C++ version to native GUI C throughout.
\item OpenGL Rendering: `Real` rendering to see what the embroidery looks like, Icons and toolbars, Menu bar.
\item Libembroidery interfacing: get all classes to use the proper libembroidery types within them. So `Ellipse` has `EmbEllipse` as public data within it.
\item Move calculations of rotation and scaling into `EmbVector` calls.
\item GUI frontend for embroider features that aren't supported by embroidermodder: flag selector from a table
\item Update all formats without color to check for edr or rgb files.
\item Setting for reverse scrolling direction (for zoom, vertical pan)
\item Better integrated help: I don't think the help should backend to a html file somewhere on the user's system. A better system would be a custom widget within the program that's searchable.
\end{itemize}

    building. Also refer to plibc.mk for example of how write an update macro for
    github.)

    necessary.
