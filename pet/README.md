# The Embroidermodder Portable Embroidery Tool (PET)

(This is in the alpha planning stage, and serves to replace our original Embroiderbot rough plan.)

A portable device for managing, altering and converting embroideries using the
[libembroidery](https://github.com/embroidermodder/libembroidery) library at your
workbench or anywhere.

Currently, this is planned to run on a
[Tufty 2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/tufty-2040) and act as a PC and
embroidery machine peripheral to transfer designs onto and from. For the up-to date
planning during this early stage see the reference manual in
[this repository](https://github.com/embroidermodder/libembroidery).

Since the _Embroidermodder PET_ is free and open source, the full cost of getting
one at launch (possibly years from now) will be no more than $30. Or a little more including cables.
