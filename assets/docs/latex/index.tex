Embroidermodder is a free machine embroidery application. The newest version, Embroidermodder 2 can\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item edit and create embroidery designs
\item estimate the amount of thread and machine time needed to stitch a design
\item convert embroidery files to a variety of formats
\item upscale or downscale designs
\item run on Windows, Mac and Linux
\end{DoxyItemize}

Embroidermodder 2 is very much a work in progress since we\textquotesingle{}re doing a ground up rewrite to an interface in C using the GUI toolkit SDL2. The reasoning for this is detailed in the issues tab.

For a more in-\/depth look at what we are developing read our \mbox{[}website\mbox{]}\textbackslash{}url\{\href{https://www.libembroidery.org}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+libembroidery.\+org}}\} which includes these docs as well as the up-\/to date printer-\/friendly versions. These discuss recent changes, plans and has user and developer guides for all the Embroidermodder projects.

To see what we\textquotesingle{}re focussing on right now, see the \mbox{[}Open Collective News\mbox{]}\textbackslash{}url\{\href{https://opencollective.com/embroidermodder}{\texttt{ https\+://opencollective.\+com/embroidermodder}}\}.

The {\itshape Embroidermodder 2} project is a collection of small software utilities for manipulating, converting and creating embroidery files in all major embroidery machine formats. The program {\itshape Embroidermodder 2} itself is a larger graphical user interface (GUI) which is at the heart of the project.

The tools and associated documents are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This website (\href{https://www.libembroidery.org}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily www.\+libembroidery.\+org}}}), which is maintained \href{https://github.com/Embroidermodder/www.libembroidery.org}{\texttt{ here}}.
\item \href{https://www.libembroidery.org/embroidermodder_2.0_manual.pdf}{\texttt{ The manual}} covering all these projects.
\item The GUI ({\ttfamily embroidermodder}), maintained \href{https://github.com/Embroidermodder/embroidermodder}{\texttt{ here}}.
\item The core library of low-\/level functions\+: \href{https://github.com/Embroidermodder/libembroidery}{\texttt{ libembroidery}}.
\item The CLI {\ttfamily embroider} which is part of \href{https://github.com/Embroidermodder/libembroidery}{\texttt{ libembroidery}}.
\item Mobile embroidery format viewers and tools (\href{https://github.com/Embroidermodder/embroiderymobile}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Embroidery\+Mobile}}})).
\item Specs for an open hardware embroidery machine called Embroiderbot (not started yet) which is also part of \href{https://github.com/Embroidermodder/libembroidery}{\texttt{ libembroidery}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

They are all tools to make the standard user experience of working with an embroidery machine better without expensive software which is locked to specific manufacturers and formats. But ultimately we hope that the core {\itshape Embroidermodder 2} is a practical, ever-\/present tool in larger workshops, small cottage industry workshops and personal hobbyist\textquotesingle{}s bedrooms.

Embroidermodder 2 is licensed under the zlib license and we aim to keep all of our tools open source and free of charge. If you would like to support the project check out our \href{https://opencollective.com/embroidermodder}{\texttt{ Open Collective}} group. If you would like to help, please join us on Git\+Hub.

The Embroidermodder Team is also inspired by the original Embroidermodder that was built by Mark Pontius and the same Josh Varga on Source\+Forge which unfortunately appears to have died from linkrot. We may create a distribution on here to be the official \char`\"{}legacy\char`\"{} Embroidermodder code but likely in a seperate repository because it\textquotesingle{}s GNU GPL v3 and this code is written to be zlib (that is, permissive licensed) all the way down.

One reason why this is useful is that the rewrite by Jonathan Greig, John Varga and Robin Swift for Embroidermodder 2 should have no regressions\+: no features present in v1 should be missing in v2.\hypertarget{index_features}{}\doxysubsubsection{Features}\label{index_features}
Embroidermodder 2 has many advanced features that enable you to create awesome designs quicker, tweak existing designs to perfection, and can be fully customized to fit your workflow.

A summary of these features\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Cross Platform
\item Realistic rendering
\item Various grid types and auto-\/adjusting rulers
\item Many measurement tools
\item Add text to any design
\item Supports many formats
\item Batch Conversion
\item Scripting API
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_cross-platform}{}\doxyparagraph{Cross Platform}\label{index_cross-platform}
If you use multiple operating systems, it\textquotesingle{}s important to choose software that works on all of them.

Embroidermodder 2 runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Let\textquotesingle{}s not forget the \href{http://www.raspberrypi.org}{\texttt{ Raspberry Pi}}.

\hypertarget{index_section}{}\doxyparagraph{Realistic Rendering}\label{index_section}
It is important to be able to visualize what a design will look like when stitched and our pseudo \`{}`3D'\textquotesingle{} realistic rendering helps achieve this.

Various grid types and auto-\/adjusting rulers

Making use of the automatically adjusting ruler in conjunction with the grid will ensure your design is properly sized and fits within your embroidery hoop area.

Use rectangular, circular or isometric grids to construct your masterpiece!

\hypertarget{index_section}{}\doxyparagraph{Realistic Rendering}\label{index_section}
Taking measurements is a critical part of creating great designs. Whether you are designing mission critical embroidered space suits for NASA or some other far out design for your next meet-\/up, you will have precise measurement tools at your command to make it happen. You can locate individual points or find distances between any 2 points anywhere in the design!

Take quick and accurate measurements\+:

\hypertarget{index_section}{}\doxyparagraph{Realistic Rendering}\label{index_section}
Need to make company apparel for all of your employees with individual names on them? No sweat. Just simply add text to your existing design or create one from scratch, quickly and easily. Didn\textquotesingle{}t get it the right size or made a typo? No problem. Just select the text and update it with the property editor.

Add text and adjust its properties quickly\+:

\hypertarget{index_section}{}\doxyparagraph{Realistic Rendering}\label{index_section}
Embroidery machines all accept different formats. There are so many formats available that it can sometimes be confusing whether a design will work with your machine.

Embroidermodder 2 supports a wide variety of embroidery formats as well as several vector formats, such as SVG and DXF. This allows you to worry less about which designs you can use.\hypertarget{index_batch-conversion}{}\doxyparagraph{Batch Conversion}\label{index_batch-conversion}
Need to send a client several different formats? Just use libembroidery-\/convert, our command line utility which supports batch file conversion.

There are a multitude of formats to choose from\+:

\hypertarget{index_scripting-api}{}\doxyparagraph{Scripting API}\label{index_scripting-api}
If you\textquotesingle{}ve got programming skills and there is a feature that isn\textquotesingle{}t currently available that you absolutely cannot live without, you have the capability to create your own custom commands for Embroidermodder 2. We provide an Qt\+Script API which exposes various application functionality so that it is possible to extend the application without requiring a new release. If you have created a command that you think is worth including in the next release, just \href{contact.html}{\texttt{ contact us}} and we will review it for functionality, bugs, and finally inclusion.

\hypertarget{index_build-and-install}{}\doxysubsubsection{\char`\"{}\+Build and Install\char`\"{}}\label{index_build-and-install}
Assuming you already have the SDL2 libraries you can proceed to using the fast build, which assumes you want to build and test locally.

The fast build should be\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}bash build.sh
\end{DoxyVerb}
 or, on Windows\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}.\build.bat
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Then run using the {\ttfamily run.\+bat} or {\ttfamily run.\+sh} scripts in the build/ directory.

Otherwise, follow the instructions below.

If you plan to install the dev version to your system (we recommend you wait for the official installers and beta release first) then use the CMake build instead.\hypertarget{index_install-desktop}{}\doxyparagraph{Install on Desktop}\label{index_install-desktop}
We recommend that if you want to install the development version you use the CMake build. Like this\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}git submodule init
git submodule update

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
sudo cmake --install .
\end{DoxyVerb}
 These lines are written into the file\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}./build_install.sh
\end{DoxyVerb}
 On Windows use the next section.\hypertarget{index_about}{}\doxysubsection{About}\label{index_about}

Embroidermodder 1 was started by Mark Pontius in 2004 while staying up all night with his son in his first couple months. When Mark returned to his day job, he lacked the time to continue the project. Mark made the decision to focus on his family and work, and in 2005, Mark gave full control of the project to Josh Varga so that Embroidermodder could continue its growth.

Embroidermodder 2 was conceived in mid 2011 when Jonathan Greig and Josh Varga discussed the possibility of making a cross-\/platform version. It is currently in active development and will run on GNU/\+Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows and Raspberry Pi.
