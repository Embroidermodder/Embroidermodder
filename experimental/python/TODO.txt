 wxPython/PySide/PyQT GUIs TODO List

"""
C++ 2 Py Porting Notes:
 000.
     'this' almost always clearly translates to 'self' in python.
 001.
     Swapping the .s and ->s between PythonQt and C++Qt pretty much ubiquitously works.
     C++ Qt
     obj->method
     vs.
     Python Qt
     obj.method
 002.
     C++ Qt
     connect(settingsSnapAction, SIGNAL(triggered()), this, SLOT(settingsSnap()));
     vs.
     Python Qt
     obj.signalDef.connet(obj.slotDef)

 # Developer Search Tags/Comments. Generally commented in upper, but some are upper/lower/mixed depending on what it is.
 # Search Tags are recommended 4 chars uppercased.
 001. TODO, littered here, there and everywhere.
 002. FIXME, usually with a TODO. Needs better understanding or help from the C++ side of things.
 003. REMOVEME, Temporary line to prevent syntax errors. Inside a TODO/FIXME section.
 004. TOWRITE, Docstrings needing doc
 005. BUG, BUGG, BUGZ, Something that acts/behaves strangely and needs review or fixing.
 006. NOTE, Important to developers mainly. Note may be platform specific, or inside a Docstring/etc.
 007. WIPZ, Work-In-Progress. Yes, the ending 'z' is a search engine thing and really does help pinpoint stuff better than any other method I have ever come across.
 008. PORT, missing from many TODO's, but is there to keep the c++ devs sanity when looking at this and scratching their head as to why something may be there...

 # Modules for shared globals/infos/etc.
 001. Menu ShortHelp, LongHelp Strings to Global Shared Strings Module. Figure out shared i18n translation macro for PySide/PyQt so both GUIs can share the same coding style. Ex: _(u'')
 002. Default Mono Font FaceNames/Sizes to Global Shared Fonts Module
 003. IconPaths to Module/Embed the Resources??? PyEmbeddedImage/app_rc/ect.
 004. wxPy Read Options from Ini.
 005.

 # Dialogs/Frames/Panels/Widgets
 001. PySide/PyQt About Dialog
 002. Both GUIs Settings Dialog
 003. Both GUIs Details Dialog
 004. Both GUIs Tip Of The Day Dialog with tips.txt.
 005. wxPython GUI Properties Panel
 006. Both GUIs The CAD Design Panel Class. This will be the hardest to port as it is the nuts & bolts of the app.
 007. wxPython GUI Custom StatusBar
 008. wxPython AUI - ToolBars & DockPanes
 009.
 010. (Sub)Class everything out so it is easiest to maintain and customize/tweak.
 011. Mixins???

 # MDIArea
 001. Ctrl+Tab Window Switcher(z-order and sorted options)
 002. Custom Right Click Context with Embroidermodder document specific options, MDIArea Options, and General MDI Options.
 003. Draggable Order Tabs. Is this possible with PySide/PyQt?
 004.

 # Documentation. ReST
 001. Every class/method/function should have documentation.
 002. Doing this on the python side of things(Readability Counts) helps the C++ side get documented
      while developers can focus on coding, not documenting for the majority of their time.
      The documentation should be written from a users easy to understand perspective,
      but still have the technical explanation stuff for more advanced users/developers.
      This means *YOU READING THIS* can help out with the documentation effort.

 # Optimization/EndResult/Nearer2Completion
 001. When GUIs are near completion, Optimize and create intelligent loops that generate everything from the globals &
       remove brunt of the GUI startup code.
 002. Less Dots/Generators Loops where can be done easily.
 003. Both GUIs PyInstaller Build/Packaging Scripts
 004. ReSTify all the Docstrings for Sphinx Documentation Generation.
 005. ??? Remove wx2.8 Code and support only wx.3.0 Classic and Phoenix or just Phoenix and remove all backwards compatible code.
 006.

 # Community discussion
 000. Don't be afraid to submit a request for something to be done.
      Global TODO list. or maybe emb-community-repo.
        while some ideas are a bit fancy, at least we will note them.
        ... so don't worry, we keep a personal list of user's requests too...
            ... even tho sometimes we ourselves think
                they may be silly or unneeded or way-out-of-our-league or skill-level.
                  The fact is...  ...is that it will live on until it gets some attention by someone someday.
            Whether a Idea is accepted or maybe as a mixin or plugin,
            in many cases has to do alot with the community accepting it,
            so therefore it is in your best interest(as a Idea person/Scientist),
            to either promote your idea or to help write some starter code
            and submit it as a proof-of-concept, just as I have(the python GUI).
 001. FunctionMethod/Class Naming conventions standards for coding guidelines
      between the C++ version and the python version(s).

       A lot of this stuff is recognised better from python(because it is readable),
       but is overall discussed better as a community as not everyone uses the same language,
       but naming conventions can be a standard. Work together on bettering it.
       Ex: dir(object)
         if I print out the object (something) at the moment...
             it would probably spit out something hard for a "real" human to
             parse mentally according to dictionary standards.
             ...Even a real dictionary(the 'Book' doesn't do it this way...)

             Ex:
              Un-sorted
               file_menu
               edit_menu
               help_menu
              vs.
               edit_menu
               file_menu
               help_menu

            ... which would be better conventionNamed as

              clearly category-sorted ByUPPERorLowerCase
               menu_Edit
               menu_File
               menu_Help

               ... in a sorted list, which BTW is what your
                   output/auto-completion will probably spit out.
                   nuff, said.
                   Mentally every time the list pops up,
                   this leaves a subconscious mark in the user's mind,
                   this should teach the user how the code is structured
                   subconscious also. Think subliminal messages.
 002. What is the next step for python users?
       A. Besides getting a fully working GUI up and running,
          we want python bindings.
       B. def ImplementTheCoolestFuncEverInTenMin():
              # Yes, do please!
