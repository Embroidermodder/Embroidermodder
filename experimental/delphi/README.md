Delphie bindings
----------------

The files and examples contained within are intended for use with Delphie/FreePascal.

Dependencies
------------

TODO: Proper download links for Lazarus, etc...

Ubuntu repository packages:
The FreePascal and Lazarus build dependencies can be installed easily by opening a terminal and issuing this command:
```
sudo apt-get install fpc-source lazarus
```
Building
--------

Windows: TODO

Linux: This is not possible at this point in time. HeadConv is Windows only and SWIG does not generate bindings at the time of writing.
