bin directory
-------------

This directory is needed by Delphi and Lazarus/FreePascal due it is the target binary output compilation (*.exe)
since Delphi didn't create the target binary output automatically.

For Windows Delphi shared library usage, put your *.dll in this directory.
For static library usage, no any *.dll file required.


Please keep this file here, since empty directory will be ignored by git.
