OSX project files
-----------------

OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion and newer should work.

We do not maintain XCode project files.
You can compile qmake .pro files via terminal using homebrew
or alternatively by using QtCreator.

Troubleshooting
---------------

GCC/G++ is currently used. If you wish to use Clang and have issues,
please open a bug report, pull request or patch and we will look into the issue.
