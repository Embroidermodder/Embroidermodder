# Overview
The main emphasis on this project, currently, is to serve as a cursory app for hacking and working with Android and embroidery.
This has lead to some spin-off functionality and utilities like EmbroideryIO which also shares parentage with `EmbroiderPy/pyembroidery` and `Embroidermodder/libembroidery`.

## Formats
Loading and saving is possible between many different formats. This functionality is part of the EmbroideryIO project which is a sister project to this one.
