## [TYPE] Your Title

My change allows (describe your new feature or bugfix).

Choose TYPE from: BUGFIX, FEATURE, ASSET or TEST.

## Testing procedure

If your addition is not simply a test already, please supply
a description of how to test it. For example, if your feature
allows a new type of stitch fill say what files you attempted
to run the fill on and on what platform and version of the software.

_I used Embroidermodder (git hash #EXAMPLE) to test my feature
on Windows 11 using the sample file "samples/filename.png"_

(Attach a picture of the result.)

## Argument for New Dependencies (if needed)

If your source code uses languages other than those present in the
source code already or requires new files or libraries, please
explain in detail why they are necessary. We're sorry if your amazing
feature is shot down on the grounds of having too many dependencies.

We are attempting to reduce and maintain lean software written
in portable C89 with as few dependencies as possible. We want Embroidermodder
to outlive our use of it, so it needs to be simple and portable.

## Declaration of Ownership

You have to agree to our licensing terms, declare your work is your own and
not add dependencies to non-permissive licensed software.

So here write a statement to this effect.
